> Dat shell. Open a remote dat and explore with cd, ls, etc.

dat-shell is part of the [dat][] Peer-to-Peer universe. It's useful to explore remote dats by their key without having to download them. Think of it as bash for dats, letting you ```cd```, ```ls``` and ```cp``` at will.

## Install
```sh
$ npm install --global dat-shell
```

### Requirements
You'll need node 8.9.1 (LTS) or above. I suggest using [n-install] to install the ```n``` node version manager.

You'll probably need ```git``` too since we're using my (temporary) fork of glob to support hyperdrives (dat archives), and that fork is only available on github and not (yet) on npm. See [below][merge-glob] to help merge my glob fork.

## Usage
```sh
$ dat-shell <dat-key> # dat-key is optionnal
```

For example, you can access this readme and scripts at: <dat://ae8c136e04a66451c79325681d4593bc3ce30c8005dfa5fc6001e0898ec4573a>

```sh
$ dat-shell dat://ae8c136e04a66451c79325681d4593bc3ce30c8005dfa5fc6001e0898ec4573a
# or
$ dat-shell ae8c136e04a66451c79325681d4593bc3ce30c8005dfa5fc6001e0898ec4573a
# or
$ dat-shell dat://dat-shell-millette.hashbase.io/
```

You might wonder about <dat://dat-shell-millette.hashbase.io/> but it's perfectly valid since the hostname maps to the ```ae8c...573a``` key through https discovery.

### Commands
* help: List of commands and their descriptions.
* .help: Internal repl commands.
* ln: Pseudo symbolic link (mkfifo).
* cp: Copy a file from remote dat to local filesystem.
* cat: View a file (concatenate).
* ls: List files.
* file: Detect mimetype.
* view: Generic view command (text, markdown, html, etc.).
* sl: Train yourself to avoid typos.
* cd: Change directory.
* pwd: Output current working directory.
* dat: dat -c to close; dat <KEY> to open; dat to output current key.
* state: Output current state.
* version: Current dat-shell version.
* exit or quit: Exit dat-shell (or CTRL-D).

#### ln
ln is a bit weird, not sure how useful it's going to be. As it's currently implemented, ln creates a fifo, writes the specified remote file (in dat) to the fifo and waits for the user to read the fifo before closing and removing it.

For instance, inside dat-shell, you can do:

```
ln readme.md ~/tmp-readme.md # ~/tmp-readme.md will be overwritten with our temporary fifo
```

And in another terminal (bash, etc.):
```
cat ~/tmp-readme.md # or tail, cp, etc.
```

You can't currently ```ln``` a video file and play it with vlc or mplayer unfortunately.

## Upgrading
The cli now uses [update-notifier][] to let the user know about updates to this program.

Users have the ability to opt-out of the update notifier by changing
the optOut property to true in ~/.config/configstore/update-notifier-dat-shell.json.
The path is available in notifier.config.path.

Users can also opt-out by setting the environment variable NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER
with any value or by using the --no-update-notifier flag on a per run basis.

To upgrade, simply
```sh
$ npm install --global dat-shell
```

## Contribute
Needless to say, I'm 100% open to contributions. Unit tests are coming soon, but for now make sure to follow the [StandardJS][standardjs] coding style (no semi-colons, etc). Run either ```yarn lint``` or ```npm run lint``` to verify.

## TODO
There's lots to do, classified here in bugs and features.

I should probably move most of the items below to GitHub issues and establish a roadmap.

### Merge glob
There's an [issue on glob to allow other fs implementations][glob280]. This allows glob to work on dat archives (and the hyperdrive beneath).

### Bugs
* [issue#1] Improve error messages
* [issue#2] Prevent cd into a file (doh)
* [issue#3] Copy to directory (currently, a destination filename is required)
* [issue#4] Improve screencast (demo), see <https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/938448616854876160>
* [issue#16] Ctrl-D doesn't always quit
* [issue#11] ln should work as expected (for mplayer, etc.)

### Features
* [issue#7] Add file autocompletion
* [issue#8] Add text browser mode (*à la* lynx)
* [issue#9] Enable usage as: dat-shell KEY ls (non-interactive)
* [issue#10] Browse versions (history)
* [issue#12] Add status bar (show when files are updated, version, etc.)
* [issue#13] Unit tests, travis, coveralls
* [issue#14] Enumerate hosts
* [issue#15] Improve args quoting (*à la* bash)
* Add more command
* Add tail command
* Add tree command
* Improve ls handling (arguments, long version, etc.)
* Colors
* Make all commands async (promises)
* Improve user responses
* Make prompt configurable (*à la* bash)
* Make statusbar configurable
* Gemnasium badge
* Support plugins
* Add debugging options and output
* Evaluate [shelljs][] for integration
* Evaluate [cash][] for integration
* Evaluate [vorpal][] for integration
* Evaluate [nsh][] for integration
* Evaluate [coreutils][] for integration
* Evaluate [bashful][] for integration
* Add bookmark support (compatible with beaker, hopefully)
* Make sure it works cross-platform (posix, windows)
* Package self-contained binary with pkg
* "Implement" [standard-readme][]

### Optimizations (speed or size)
* Replace marked-terminal and update-notifier with smaller equivalents

### Ideas from #dat on freenode (IRC)
* creationix: would be cool to have the ability to run scripts in dat-shell
* creationix: pluggable vms for running scripts, scripts could list dependencies via dat urls, maybe even load native vm code from dats
* scriptjs: Would be nice if the licence for dat-shell was aligned with the dat ecosystem MIT please
